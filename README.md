Project 2: Resume Analyzer & Job Matcher Specification Sheet
1. Overview
Resume Analyzer & Job Matcher is an application that parses a candidate’s resume, extracts key information (such as skills, education, and work experience), and compares it with a target job description to assess compatibility. The system provides feedback and recommendations to help job seekers optimize their resumes for specific roles. This project combines NLP, machine learning, and full-stack web development to deliver a tool that not only analyzes text but also offers actionable insights.

2. Objectives
Enhance Resume Visibility: Enable job seekers to understand how well their resume matches the requirements of a target job.
Automated Analysis: Utilize NLP to extract structured data from resumes and job descriptions.
Data-Driven Recommendations: Compute a compatibility score using text-similarity measures (like TF-IDF and cosine similarity) and provide suggestions to improve alignment with job requirements.
Showcase Skills: Demonstrate your expertise in Python (NLP/ML), JavaScript (React), and web development with Django, making you an attractive candidate for internships in data science and software development.

3. Functional Requirements
User Interface (Frontend)
File Upload: Users can upload resumes (PDF/DOCX) and paste or upload job descriptions.
Results Display: Display a compatibility score, a list of matched skills, and suggestions for improvement.
Interactive Elements: Allow users to drill down into specific parts of the analysis (e.g., view extracted skills, and compare against job requirements).
Responsive Design: Ensure the UI works on desktops and mobile devices.
Backend (API)
File Processing: An endpoint to receive and process resume files using text extraction libraries (e.g., pdfminer.six for PDFs, docx2txt for DOCX).
NLP Analysis: Utilize spaCy to extract entities (skills, education, work experience) from resumes and job descriptions.
Similarity Computation: Implement a mechanism (using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity) to compare the extracted resume content with job description keywords.
Feedback Generation: Return a compatibility score and highlight key skill gaps or areas of alignment.
Database (Iteration)
User Data: If extended to support user accounts, store resumes, historical analysis data, and user preferences.
Job Descriptions: Optionally, store past job descriptions for trend analysis.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:
The backend should process the resume and job description analysis within a few seconds.
API responses for file upload and analysis should be returned in real-time.
Scalability:
Design the system to handle multiple concurrent users and file uploads.
Security:
Ensure secure file handling and user data privacy.
Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
Usability:
The interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
Provide clear instructions and feedback on the analysis results.

5. Technology Stack
Frontend:
React: For building a responsive and dynamic user interface.
JavaScript/TypeScript: For client-side logic.
CSS/SCSS or Styled Components: For styling the application.
Backend:
Django: To create a RESTful API for file processing and NLP analysis.
Python: For integrating NLP (using spaCy) and similarity computations.
NLP Libraries:
spaCy: For extracting entities and performing initial NLP tasks.
File Processing Libraries:
pdfminer.six: For extracting text from PDF resumes.
docx2txt: For extracting text from DOCX resumes.
Database (Iteration):
SQLite: For initial development.
PostgreSQL: For production-level deployment (if user accounts and persistent data are needed).
Version Control:
Git/GitHub: For source code management and collaboration.

Data Flow:
User Interaction:
The user uploads a resume and inputs a job description via the React UI.
API Request:
The frontend sends a request to the backend with the uploaded files and text data.
File Extraction:
The backend uses pdfminer.six or docx2txt to extract raw text from the resume.
NLP Processing:
The extracted text and job description are processed by the NLP module to extract structured data (skills, education, etc.).
Similarity Analysis:
The system computes a similarity score between the resume and job description using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.
Response:
The backend returns the analysis results (score, matched skills, and recommendations) to the frontend.
Display:
The frontend displays the results to the user in a clear and actionable format.

7. Implementation Phases
Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
Setup Environment:
Configure a Git repository, set up Django backend, and create a basic React frontend.
File Processing:
Implement endpoints to handle file uploads and extract text using pdfminer.six and docx2txt.
Basic NLP & Similarity:
Use spaCy to perform simple entity extraction from resumes and job descriptions.
Compute a basic compatibility score using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.
User Interface:
Develop a simple React UI that allows users to upload files, input job descriptions, and view analysis results.
Phase 2: Extended Features
Advanced NLP Processing:
Enhance entity extraction with more robust NLP models (potentially integrating BERT or fine-tuned transformers).
UI Enhancements:
Improve the front end with more interactive elements, such as visual indicators for matching skills and gaps.
User Accounts & History (Optional):
Implement user authentication to allow job seekers to save and track multiple analyses.
API Integration:
Integrate external APIs (LinkedIn, Glassdoor) to fetch live job description data and refine matching algorithms.
Phase 3: Testing & Deployment
Testing:
Write unit tests for backend endpoints (using pytest/unittest for Python) and React component tests using Jest and React Testing Library.
Deployment:
Deploy the backend on a cloud platform (Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean).
Deploy the frontend (using Netlify, Vercel, or similar).
Documentation:
Create user documentation and technical documentation to detail the API endpoints and system architecture.
